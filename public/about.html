<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2><p>Hey, I’m a 24-year-old guy from Iraq who’s basically a professional chill-seeker. How? Simple: movies, shows, and anime.
I’ll watch anything that doesn’t put me to sleep The Hateful Eight and Django Unchained are my go-tos when I want drama.
Se7en? Great, but I’ll never look at a cardboard box the same way again.</p></h2>

<p><h2>When I’m not screen-glued, I’m getting my ass kicked in The Witcher 3 or Elden Ring (yes, I hate myself just enough to keep playing).
Or debating whether I should adopt a cat. (I’m 100% a cat person—I just haven’t convinced one to move in yet. Negotiations ongoing.)</p></h2>

<p><h2>Also, I’m “learning programming,” which is a fancy way of saying I yell at my laptop until it does something cool. Progress? Debatable.
But hey, maybe I’ll invent an app that auto-generates excuses for skipping plans.</p></h2>

<h3>TL;DR: Movie buff, aspiring cat butler, and part-time code whisperer.</h3>
