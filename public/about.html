<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I’m a 24-year-old guy from Iraq who’s really good at sitting still.
  How? Simple: movies, shows, and anime. I’ll watch anything that doesn’t put me to sleep—Hateful Eight and Django Unchained are my go-tos when I want to see people argue in cowboy hats.
  Inception and Interstellar are cool too, I guess, if you’re into "wait, what’s happening?" plots. Se7en? Great, but I’ll never look at a cardboard box the same way again.</p>

  <p>When I’m not staring at screens, I’m either losing at video games (RPGs are my excuse for ignoring real life) or being ignored by my cat.
  Yes, I’m a cat person—dogs are too much work, and let’s be honest, cats are just tiny roommates who don’t pay rent.</p>

<p>Oh, and I’m "learning programming." Translation: I Google why my code doesn’t work for 5 hours a day. It’s fine.</p>
<p>  One day I’ll make something useful, like an app that reminds me to stop rewatching The Office for the 10th time.</p>

TL;DR: I like stuff, but not enough to tattoo it on my body
